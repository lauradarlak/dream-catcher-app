# Sinatra Portfolio Project: Dream Catcher App

## Overview
Dream Catcher is a CRUD, Model-View-Controller application using Sinatra. This app allows users to keep track of their dreams. Each dream receives a name and description and can be assigned user-created themes. Users' dream data is persisted in a SQLite3 database and accessed by Active Record Object Relational Mapping (ORM). User's are able to create new dreams, view individual dreams and a dream index, edit and delete dreams. Data on dream themes are presented to each user in a theme index.

## Install Instructions
* Fork the dream-catcher-app repository
* Clone it locally
* Run `bundle install`
* Start up the app by running `shotgun` in the terminal. Visit the homepage at localhost:9393 or, if different, the server address generated by shotgun
* Populate the database
```
rake db:migrate
```
For testing, seed data is provided and accessible via `rake db:seed`
